                <p><strong>Currently requires using UDONSharp. CyanTriggers and Graph support requires using the wrapper version in place of the UDONSharp version of the prefab!</strong></p>
                <h1">What is Combat Link?</h1>
                <p>Combat Link is a system/standard in which allows a world to give your avatar&#39;s HUD data, such as your health, status effects, and other information. All in a prefab you can stick on your avatar!</p>
                <h1>Who made made it? Why?</h1>
                <p>I (Snipeslow) started this project a long time ago when I noticed a shader based workaround (popularized by AudioLink&#39;s method) to get data to avatars. Made easier with an official VRC update that introduced the method in a more proper manner. However, it took a long time to figure out how to make a screen space HUD, due to not understanding matrices until recently (even then, it&#39;s still an eldritch thing to me). I made the system to be used by the Avatar PVP community, free. And other communities too.</p>
                <h1>Can you make <em>X</em> hud from <em>X</em> game?</h1>
                <p>I do not take requests. BUT I am willing to teach, either through video tutorials or direct teaching if I spot ya in a voice channel. Planned HUDs I will have outright are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Star Wars Clone Commando</li>
                    <li>Halo Reach MJOLNIR Mark V</li>
                    <li>My Example HUD</li>
                    <li>Half Life 2 HEV</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Can you make a Dead Space style health bar?</h1>
                <p>No, due to how Combat Link sends data. There might be a way to do it later, but I will have to research it.</p>
                <h1>Features</h1>
